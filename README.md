# 🏉 Scrum Evolution Guide
*From Waterfall flops to Scrum’s rugby-powered rise—how Agile conquered software dev!*

Hey there! I’m Khaja Shaik, a curious SDET who dug into Scrum’s wild history while nailing my **Scrum Foundation Professional Certificate (CertiProf)** and **Certified Associate in Scrum Fundamentals™ (SkillFront)**. This repo’s got the full story—fun, detailed, and a bit cheeky.

## What’s Inside?
- 📄 **Scrum_Evolution.pdf**: The ultimate guide to Scrum’s origin, with humor and storytelling.
- 🎥 **scrum_teaser.mp4**: A 15-sec blast of why Scrum rules (I tried but wasn't able to make it).

## Why This Matters
Software dev was a mess—rigid models like Waterfall crashed hard. Then came Agile in 2001, and Scrum turned chaos into teamwork. Want the juicy details? Dive in!
